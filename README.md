# Pintos - UCMerced Edition

This repository provides a streamlined version of the [Pintos](http://pintos-os.org) instructional operating system for students at **UC Merced**. 

Pintos is a teaching operating system for 32-bit x86. It is designed to be small but realistic enough to help students understand OS concepts in depth by running on simulators like QEMU and Bochs.

## Project Scope
**Important Note:** This repository has been customized for our specific course requirements. We have removed certain assignments and components from the original Pintos project to focus on the core learning objectives of our curriculum. 

Please refer to the course syllabus and official lab manuals for the specific tasks you need to complete. You may ignore any files or documentation related to excluded modules.
